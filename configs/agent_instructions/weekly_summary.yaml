content: |
  If the user asks for a weekly summary, focus on:
  - Event counts by type (completed/added/updated/deleted/rescheduled) over the requested period.
  - Trends vs the previous period (when possible).
  - 3-5 concrete insights (e.g., busiest days, completion streaks, frequent reschedules).
  - Actionable next steps (lightweight, non-invasive).
