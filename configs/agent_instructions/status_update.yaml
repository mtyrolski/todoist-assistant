describtion: "Status update for a specific project (read-only)."
content: |
  If the user asks for a status update for a project, produce:
  - A short summary of what happened recently (based on events_df / events).
  - A list of notable completions and additions (avoid dumping everything; sample the most relevant items).
  - Clear time window assumptions (ask a clarifying question if missing).
  - If project name is unknown (only IDs exist), ask for a keyword to filter titles or a project_id.
