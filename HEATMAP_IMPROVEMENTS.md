# Heatmap Improvement Summary

## Problem Statement
The "Heatmap of Events by Day and Hour" was not informative and didn't display well in dark mode.

## Issues Identified
- ❌ Used basic `px.imshow()` with default styling
- ❌ No dark mode compatibility 
- ❌ Minimal customization and poor informativeness
- ❌ Used numeric day indices (0-6) instead of readable day names
- ❌ Basic axis labels and minimal hover information
- ❌ Default color scheme that didn't work well in dark environments

## Improvements Made

### 🌙 Dark Mode Compatibility
- Applied `plotly_dark` template with custom dark color scheme
- Dark backgrounds: `#111318` for paper and plot areas
- White text and borders for visibility
- Custom grid colors with low opacity for subtle appearance

### 🎨 Enhanced Visual Design
- **Better Color Scale**: Custom colorscale from dark blue (low activity) to red (high activity)
- **Day Names**: Monday-Sunday instead of numeric indices (0-6)
- **Time Formatting**: Readable hour labels (12 AM, 9 AM, 2 PM, 12 PM (noon), etc.)
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent fonts, margins, and spacing

### 📊 Improved Informativeness  
- **Rich Hover Tooltips**: Shows day name, readable time, event count, and percentage of total
- **Peak Activity Annotation**: Automatically highlights the time with highest activity
- **Complete Data Coverage**: Ensures all 24 hours and 7 days are always shown
- **Event Count Colorbar**: Clear legend with proper dark mode styling

### 🛡️ Robust Data Handling
- **Empty Data Handling**: Shows appropriate "No Data" message when dataset is empty
- **Edge Cases**: Properly handles single-day data and sparse datasets
- **Data Completeness**: Fills missing hours/days with zeros for complete picture

### 🎯 Enhanced User Experience
- **Better Axis Labels**: Clear titles and properly formatted tick labels
- **Improved Margins**: Proper spacing for readability
- **Consistent Theming**: Matches the styling of other plots in the application
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors and readable fonts

## Technical Implementation
- Replaced `px.imshow()` with `go.Heatmap()` for better control
- Added comprehensive layout configuration for dark mode
- Implemented custom hover text generation
- Added peak detection and annotation logic
- Ensured data completeness with proper indexing

## Result
The heatmap now provides actionable insights about activity patterns throughout the week and looks professional in dark mode environments. Users can easily identify:
- Peak activity times
- Daily activity patterns 
- Weekly activity distribution
- Specific event counts and percentages

The visualization is now truly informative and visually appealing in dark mode.
